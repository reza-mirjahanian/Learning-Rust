#### How does the  justify preferring Self in implementations?
A48: The  responds, "I personally prefer using self, as I mentioned, because it means that if I change the name of the type, I don't have to change anything else," valuing its refactoring ease despite potential local reasoning challenges.

#### Q50: How does the  address the use of associated types versus generics?
A50: The  advises, "use generics if you think that multiple implementations of that trait might exist for a given type. Use associated types if only one implementation makes sense for any given type," referencing the Rust book for further detail.

#### Q84: How does the  explain the ref and ref mut keywords?
A84: The  explains:
ref: "Means that I’m matching into a reference… I want a reference to the thing I’m matching."

ref mut: "I want to get a mutable reference to the thing I’m matching," allowing modification without moving the value.
