In Rust, you **rarely need to call `drop()` manually** ‚Äî the compiler automatically calls `Drop::drop()` when a value goes out of scope.

But there **are a few legitimate cases** where calling `std::mem::drop()` manually is **useful or necessary**.

---

## ‚úÖ When to Call `drop()` Manually

### 1. **To release a resource early**

If a variable owns a resource (file, lock, socket, etc.), and you want to **free it before the end of scope**, use `drop()`:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;

fn main() {
    let mut file = File::create("out.txt").unwrap();
    writeln!(file, "Hello!").unwrap();

    std::mem::drop(file); // file is closed *here*, not at end of scope

    // Now you can do something else knowing the file is closed
}
```

---

### 2. **To avoid borrow checker conflicts (e.g. when re-borrowing)**

When a value is borrowed mutably, the compiler doesn‚Äôt allow other borrows until that borrow ends. Manually dropping helps in **narrowing the lifetime**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r = &s;
    println!("{}", r);

    // s.push_str(" world"); // ‚ùå can't mutate while borrowed
    drop(r); // ‚úÖ end the borrow early
    s.push_str(" world"); // ‚úÖ allowed now
}
```

---

### 3. **To explicitly destroy something in unsafe code**

In **unsafe or low-level FFI code**, you might call `drop()` explicitly when managing raw resources.

---

## ‚ùå When *not* to call `drop()` manually

* Don‚Äôt call `x.drop()` directly ‚Äî use `std::mem::drop(x)` instead.
* Don‚Äôt call `drop()` on stack variables just to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù ‚Äî **Rust does that automatically**.
* Never call `drop()` **twice** ‚Äî it leads to **use-after-free**, which is undefined behavior.

```rust
let s = String::from("hi");
drop(s);
// drop(s); // ‚ùå error: use of moved value
```
