[Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html#reference-cycles-can-leak-memory)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rust's memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a *memory leak*). Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust's guarantees, meaning memory leaks are memory safe in Rust. We can see that Rust allows memory leaks by using `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`: it's possible to create references where items refer to each other in a cycle. This creates memory leaks because the reference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values will never be dropped.
