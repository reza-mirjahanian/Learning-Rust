## 1. Overview

- **`Rc<T>`** (Reference Counted) is a smart pointer for **shared ownership** in **single-threaded** scenarios.
- It enables multiple parts of a program to own the same data on the heap.
- When the last `Rc<T>` goes out of scope, the inner data is dropped.
- **Important:** It does not allow mutation by default; to enable interior mutability, combine it with `RefCell<T>`.

---

## 2. Basic Usage

### Creating and Cloning an `Rc<T>`

- **Creation:** Use `Rc::new(value)`
- **Cloning:** Calling `.clone()` creates another pointer to the same value and increases the reference count (an O(1) operation).

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let num = Rc::new(5);
    println!("Initial reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&num)); // 1

    {
        let num_clone = Rc::clone(&num);
        println!("Reference count after clone: {}", Rc::strong_count(&num)); // 2
    }

    println!("Reference count after clone goes out of scope: {}", Rc::strong_count(&num)); // 1
}
```

### Getting a Mutable Reference (When Safe)

- **`Rc::get_mut`** returns a mutable reference only if the reference count is exactly 1 (no other sharers).

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let mut data = Rc::new(42);
    // Safe only if no other clones exist
    if let Some(val) = Rc::get_mut(&mut data) {
        *val += 1;
    }
    println!("Data after mutation: {}", data);
}
```

## 3. Combining `Rc<T>` with Interior Mutability

Since `Rc<T>` only provides shared (immutable) access by default, wrap your inner type with `RefCell<T>` to allow mutation at runtime:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let shared_number = Rc::new(RefCell::new(0));

    {
        let shared_clone = Rc::clone(&shared_number);
        // Borrow mutably from within the scope
        *shared_clone.borrow_mut() = 10;
    }

    println!("Updated number: {}", shared_number.borrow());
}
```

**Edge Case:** Misusing `borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` on a `RefCell` (e.g., trying to borrow mutably while an immutable borrow is active) will cause a runtime panic.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

fn borrow_error() {
    let shared = Rc::new(RefCell::new(1));
    let _first_borrow = shared.borrow();
    // The following line would panic at runtime:
    // let _mut_borrow = shared.borrow_mut();
}
```

## 4. Handling Cycles with `Rc<T>` and `Weak<T>`

### The Cycle Problem

- **Pitfall:** Creating cyclic references with `Rc<T>` can lead to **memory leaks** because the reference count never reaches zero.
  
For example, a parent–child data structure might accidentally form a cycle if the child owns an `Rc<T>` reference to its parent.

### Breaking Cycles Using `Weak<T>`

- Use `Weak<T>` to hold non-owning references which do not increment the strong count.

```rust
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>, // non-owning link to parent
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

fn cycle_example() {
    // Create a leaf node.
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    // Create a branch node that owns the leaf.
    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
    });

    // Set the leaf's parent using a weak pointer to avoid a cycle.
    *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

    println!(
        "Leaf's parent (upgrade result): {:?}",
        leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade()
    );
}

fn main() {
    cycle_example();
}
```

- **`Rc::downgrade(&rc)`** creates a weak reference that can later be **upgraded** to an `Rc<T>` if the value is still available:
  
```rust
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

fn weak_usage() {
    let strong = Rc::new(10);
    let weak_ref: Weak<i32> = Rc::downgrade(&strong);

    drop(strong); // Drop the strong Rc; now the value might be gone.

    if let Some(v) = weak_ref.upgrade() {
        println!("Value still exists: {}", v);
    } else {
        println!("Value has been dropped.");
    }
}
```

## 5. Performance and Complexity (O Notation)

| Operation                | Complexity/Notes                                                     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clone**                | O(1): Increments the reference count.                                |
| **Drop**                 | O(1): Decrements the count and drops data if count reaches zero.     |
| **`Rc::get_mut`**        | O(1), but only returns `Some(&mut T)` when the strong count is exactly 1. |
| **`Weak::upgrade`**      | O(1): Checks if the data is still alive and returns an `Rc<T>` if so. |

- **Overhead:** Low overhead compared to thread-safe variants (since `Rc<T>` is non-atomic), but be cautious of cycles which may incur memory leaks if not properly managed.

| **Thread Safety**  | Not thread-safe                                  | Thread-safe (atomic operations are used)               |
| **Use-case**       | Single-threaded environments                    | Multi-threaded/shared ownership scenarios              |
| **Performance**    | Faster (no atomic overhead)                     | Slightly slower due to atomic reference counting       |
| **Memory Overhead**| Lower                                             | Slightly higher due to atomic operations               |

| **Ownership**     | Multiple shared owners                 | Single owner (unique ownership)             |
| **Mutability**    | Immutable by default (use `RefCell<T>` for mutation) | Mutable (if declared mutable)          |
| **Overhead**      | Extra overhead for tracking references | Minimal overhead                            |

## 7. Pros and Cons Table

| Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enables shared ownership in single-threaded contexts.              | **Not thread-safe:** Cannot be sent across threads; use `Arc<T>` for multi-thread scenarios.    |
| Low overhead due to non-atomic reference counting.                   | **Cycle Risk:** Cyclic references can lead to memory leaks unless broken by using `Weak<T>`.      |
| Clone and drop operations are O(1) in complexity.                    | Immutable by default – interior mutability requires wrapping in types like `RefCell<T>`.         |
| Useful for tree/graph data structures with shared nodes.             | Debugging reference count issues can sometimes be tricky.                                     |

## 8. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use with Immutable Data:**  
  Use `Rc<T>` when you do not require mutation. If mutation is necessary, use `Rc<RefCell<T>>` or other interior mutability patterns.

- **Avoid Cycles:**  
  Always consider the potential for cyclic references. When part of a cycle, use `Weak<T>` for one of the links to allow proper cleanup.

- **Check Reference Counts:**  
  Utilize `Rc::strong_count(&rc)` and `Rc::weak_count(&rc)` for debugging to understand how many active references exist.

- **Leverage `Rc::get_mut`:**  
  In cases where you hold exclusive ownership (strong count == 1), use it to get a mutable reference without additional overhead.

- **Threading Consideration:**  
  Never try sharing an `Rc<T>` across threads; the compiler will prevent it. For multi-threaded shared ownership, choose `Arc<T>` instead.

- **Be Wary of RefCell Panics:**  
  When combining `Rc<T>` with `RefCell<T>`, ensure that borrow rules are respected to avoid runtime panics due to violating the borrowing rules.

- **Minimal Cloning:**  
  Remember that `clone()` only copies the pointer (increasing the counter), not the actual data—so cloning is cheap, but unnecessary cloning may make reasoning about ownership harder.

## 9. Edge Case Examples

### Accidental Thread Sharing Prevention

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::thread;

fn thread_error() {
    let data = Rc::new(10);
    // The following would not compile because Rc<T> does not implement Send:
    // thread::spawn(move || {
    //     println!("Data: {}", data);
    // }).join().unwrap();
}
```

### Using `Rc::get_mut` Correctly

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn mutable_example() {
    let mut value = Rc::new(42);
    // Safe mutation since no other clones exist.
    if let Some(v) = Rc::get_mut(&mut value) {
        *v += 1;
        println!("Mutated value: {}", v);
    }
}
```
