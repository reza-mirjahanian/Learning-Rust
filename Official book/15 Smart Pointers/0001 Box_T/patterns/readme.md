## 🔹 `let mut`: Mutability of the *binding*

```rust
let mut y = 10;
```

This means:

> "I can **reassign** or **mutate** the value bound to the variable `y`."

So:

```rust
let mut y = 10;
y = 20; // ✅ allowed, because `y` is mutable
```

If you had written `let y = 10;`, then `y = 20;` would **not compile**.

Also:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
v.push(4); // ✅ allowed, because `v` is mutable
```

If `v` were **not** declared `mut`, you'd get an error:

> "cannot borrow as mutable"

---

## 🔹 `&mut`: Mutability of the *borrow*

```rust
let mut y = 10;
let mr = &mut y;
```

This means:

> "`mr` is a **mutable reference** to `y`, and it allows changing the value inside `y`."

```rust
*mr += 5;
println!("{}", y); // prints 15
```

## 🔁 Analogy

| Expression        | Means                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `let mut y = 10`  | "I can **change what `y` holds**"                |
| `let mr = &mut y` | "I can **change the value of `y` through `mr`**" |

## ❌ What you *can’t* do:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let r = &x;
*r = 10; // ❌ Error: can't assign to data through `&`
```

Because `r` is an immutable reference.

---

## ✅ What you *can* do:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let r = &mut x;
*r = 10; // ✅ Works because `r` is a mutable reference
```

---

## 💡 Bonus: `let x = &mut y;` without `let mut x`

```rust
let mut y = 5;
let x = &mut y;
*x += 1; // ✅ x doesn’t need to be mut! The *value* it points to is mutable
```

You don’t need `let mut x` here, because you’re not reassigning `x`, just modifying what it points to.

## 🔑 Summary

| Syntax                 | Mutability of...             | Can reassign? | Can mutate inner value? |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `let x = val`          | Neither                      | ❌             | ❌                       |
| `let mut x = val`      | Binding (`x`)                | ✅             | ✅ (if type is mutable)  |
| `let x = &val`         | Immutable reference          | ❌             | ❌                       |
| `let x = &mut val`     | Mutable reference            | ❌             | ✅                       |
| `let mut x = &mut val` | Both the ref and the binding | ✅             | ✅                       |
