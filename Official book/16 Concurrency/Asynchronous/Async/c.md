## 1. Introduction to Asynchronous Programming

**What is Asynchronous Programming?**
Asynchronous programming is a paradigm that allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently without necessarily using multiple threads. Instead of waiting for a long-running operation (like I/O) to complete (blocking), the program can switch to other tasks and be notified when the initial operation is finished.

**Why is it Needed?**
*   **I/O-Bound Operations:** Many applications spend a significant amount of time waiting for external operations like network requests, file system access, or database queries. During this waiting time, a synchronous program would block, wasting CPU resources. Asynchronous programming allows the CPU to do other work.
*   **Concurrency:** Efficiently handle many concurrent operations (e.g., thousands of network connections on a server) without the high overhead of creating a thread for each one.
*   **Responsiveness:** Keep applications (especially UIs or servers) responsive even when performing long-running tasks in the background.

**Blocking vs. Non-blocking Operations:**
*   **Blocking:** A blocking call does not return until the operation is complete. If the operation takes a long time, the calling thread is stuck waiting.
    ```rust
    // Example of a blocking operation (conceptual)
    fn read_file_sync(path: &str) -> String {
        // This would block the current thread until the file is read
        std::fs::read_to_string(path).unwrap()
    }
    ```
*   **Non-blocking:** A non-blocking call initiates an operation and returns immediately, often with a handle or a way to check progress later. The thread is free to do other work.
    ```rust
    // Example of a non-blocking operation (conceptual with async)
    async fn read_file_async(path: &str) -> String {
        // This initiates reading but allows other tasks to run while waiting
        tokio::fs::read_to_string(path).await.unwrap()
    }
    ```

**Concurrency vs. Parallelism:**
*   **Concurrency:** The ability to manage multiple tasks and make progress on them over overlapping time periods. Tasks can be interleaved on a single CPU core. This is what async primarily provides.
*   **Parallelism:** The ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores. Async tasks *can* run in parallel if the executor uses a thread pool.

**Comparison with Other Concurrency Models:**

| Feature         | Threads                                  | Async (Rust)                             | Callbacks (e.g., old JS)           |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Unit**        | OS Thread                                | Task (Future)                            | Function                             |
| **Overhead**    | High (stack, kernel resources)           | Low (state machine, heap allocation)     | Very Low                           |
| **Switching**   | Preemptive (OS scheduler)                | Cooperative (at `.await` points)         | Event loop driven                  |
| **Complexity**  | Synchronization (mutexes, etc.), deadlocks | `Send`/`Sync`, `Pin`, executor details   | Callback hell, error handling      |
| **Scalability** | Limited by OS thread limits              | High (can handle many tasks)             | High                               |
| **CPU-bound**   | Good for parallelism                     | Not ideal alone; use `spawn_blocking`    | Not ideal                          |
| **I/O-bound**   | Can be inefficient due to blocking       | Excellent                                | Good                               |

## 2. The `Future` Trait

**Definition and Purpose:**
A **`Future`** in Rust is a core concept representing a value that might not be available yet. It's an abstraction for an asynchronous computation that will eventually produce a result or an error. Futures are **lazy**; they don't do any work until they are polled.

**The `Future` Trait Definition:**
The `std::future::Future` trait is defined (simplified) as:
```rust
pub trait Future {
    type Output; // The type of value this future will produce upon completion

    fn poll(
        self: Pin<&mut Self>, // The future itself, pinned to prevent moving
        cx: &mut Context<'_>  // Context, primarily for accessing the Waker
    ) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}
```
*   **`Output`**: An associated type representing the value the future will resolve to. For example, `String` for a future that reads a file, or `Result<Response, Error>` for a network request.
*   **`poll` method**: This is the heart of a future. An **executor** calls this method to drive the future towards completion.
    *   `self: Pin<&mut Self>`: The future is passed by pinned mutable reference. Pinning is crucial because futures can be self-referential (store pointers to their own data), and moving them would invalidate these pointers. We'll cover `Pin` in detail later.
    *   `cx: &mut Context<'_>`: The context provides access to a **`Waker`**. If the future isn't ready to produce a value yet, it must arrange for the `Waker` to be called when it *might* be ready. The executor uses this `Waker` to know when to poll the future again.
    *   It returns `Poll<Self::Output>`:
        *   `Poll::Ready(value: Self::Output)`: The future has completed, and `value` is its result.
        *   `Poll::Pending`: The future is not yet complete. It has (hopefully) registered the `Waker` from the `Context` to be notified when it should be polled again.

**`Poll` Enum:**
```rust
pub enum Poll<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending,
}
```

**Manual `Future` Implementation (Simple Example):**
Let's create a simple future that completes after a certain number of polls.
```rust
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll, Waker};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

// A future that completes after a delay by sleeping on a separate thread
// and using a Waker to signal completion.
struct DelayFuture {
    duration: Duration,
    state: DelayState,
}

enum DelayState {
    Initial,
    Waiting(Waker), // Store the waker
    Done,
}

impl DelayFuture {
    fn new(duration: Duration) -> Self {
        DelayFuture {
            duration,
            state: DelayState::Initial,
        }
    }
}

impl Future for DelayFuture {
    type Output = String; // This future will produce a String

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        match self.state {
            DelayState::Initial => {
                println!("DelayFuture: Initial poll, starting timer thread.");
                let waker = cx.waker().clone(); // Clone the waker to send to the thread
                let duration = self.duration;

                thread::spawn(move || {
                    println!("Timer thread: Sleeping for {:?}", duration);
                    thread::sleep(duration);
                    println!("Timer thread: Waking up the task.");
                    waker.wake(); // Signal the executor to poll again
                });

                // Transition to Waiting state, storing the waker for potential re-polls
                // if the executor polls before the timer thread wakes it.
                self.state = DelayState::Waiting(cx.waker().clone());
                Poll::Pending
            }
            DelayState::Waiting(ref waker_stored) => {
                // If the executor polls again before the timer thread has called wake(),
                // we might need to update the waker if it's different.
                // This ensures the *latest* waker is used.
                if !waker_stored.will_wake(cx.waker()) {
                     println!("DelayFuture: Waker updated.");
                     self.state = DelayState::Waiting(cx.waker().clone());
                }
                println!("DelayFuture: Still waiting...");
                Poll::Pending
            }
            DelayState::Done => {
                // This state should ideally not be polled again if Ready was returned.
                // But for robustness, handle it.
                // Or, more typically, this means the timer completed and woke us.
                println!("DelayFuture: Timer finished, ready!");
                Poll::Ready("Timer Complete!".to_string())
            }
        }
    }
}

// A very simple executor to run our future
fn run_future<F: Future>(mut future: F) -> F::Output {
    // For simplicity, we don't handle Pin correctly here for general futures.
    // This works because our DelayFuture is Unpin (implicitly).
    // A real executor needs to handle pinning properly.
    let mut future = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&mut future) };

    // A simple Waker that does nothing, as we'll just spin-poll for this demo.
    // In a real executor, this would schedule the task.
    let waker = noop_waker::noop_waker();
    let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&waker);

    loop {
        match future.as_mut().poll(&mut cx) {
            Poll::Ready(val) => return val,
            Poll::Pending => {
                // In a real executor, we'd wait for a waker.wake() call.
                // Here, our DelayFuture's timer thread will eventually cause
                // a conceptual "wake" by setting its internal state or
                // by the executor noticing the waker has been called (if it were more complex).
                // For this manual example, the state transition inside DelayFuture
                // upon the next poll (after the thread::sleep) will lead to Ready.
                // To make DelayFuture truly work with an executor, its wake() call
                // would signal the executor to re-poll. Our current DelayFuture
                // doesn't actually change its state to Done *until* it's polled again
                // *after* the timer thread calls waker.wake().
                //
                // Let's simulate the timer thread completing and the main thread
                // noticing it by setting the state for the *next* poll.
                // This is a hack for this simple executor.
                // A better DelayFuture would use a shared flag or channel.

                // A better way to structure DelayFuture for a real executor:
                // 1. `poll`: If first time, spawn thread, store waker, return Pending.
                // 2. Thread: sleeps, then calls `waker.wake()`.
                // 3. Executor: receives wake, schedules future for polling.
                // 4. `poll` (again): checks if timer is done (e.g., via a shared flag), returns Ready.

                // For this specific example, we can simplify the DelayFuture to make it work with a spin-poll.
                // Let's rewrite DelayFuture for this simple runner.

                // (Revisiting DelayFuture to work with this simplified runner better)
                // The provided DelayFuture is actually designed for a real waker system.
                // For a spin-poll runner, it's harder to demonstrate `Waker` correctly.
                // Let's assume a proper executor exists for the DelayFuture as written above.
                // The main point is the structure of poll and the use of Waker.
                println!("Runner: Future is pending, sleeping briefly before re-polling...");
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)); // Simulate waiting for wake
            }
        }
    }
}

// A helper for the simple executor
mod noop_waker {
    use std::task::{RawWaker, RawWakerVTable, Waker};
    fn noop_clone(_: *const ()) -> RawWaker { RawWaker::new(std::ptr::null(), &NOOP_VTABLE) }
    fn noop_wake(_: *const ()) {}
    fn noop_wake_by_ref(_: *const ()) {}
    fn noop_drop(_: *const ()) {}
    static NOOP_VTABLE: RawWakerVTable = RawWakerVTable::new(noop_clone, noop_wake, noop_wake_by_ref, noop_drop);
    pub fn noop_waker() -> Waker { unsafe { Waker::from_raw(RawWaker::new(std::ptr::null(), &NOOP_VTABLE)) } }
}


// To actually run this example, you'd typically use an async runtime like tokio.
// The `run_future` above is a highly simplified and somewhat incorrect executor.
// Let's show how it would be used with tokio (conceptual, DelayFuture needs adjustment for tokio's timer).

// For a more practical manual future, consider a counter:
struct CounterFuture {
    count: u32,
    target: u32,
}

impl CounterFuture {
    fn new(target: u32) -> Self {
        CounterFuture { count: 0, target }
    }
}

impl Future for CounterFuture {
    type Output = u32;

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        if self.count < self.target {
            println!("CounterFuture: Polled, count = {}", self.count);
            self.count += 1;
            // We are not ready yet, but we made progress.
            // We need to tell the executor to poll us again.
            // If this future depended on an external event, it would store cx.waker().clone()
            // and call waker.wake() when the event occurs.
            // Since this future can always make progress, we ask to be polled again immediately.
            cx.waker().wake_by_ref(); // Request to be polled again
            Poll::Pending
        } else {
            println!("CounterFuture: Reached target {}", self.target);
            Poll::Ready(self.target)
        }
    }
}

// fn main() {
//     // Using the CounterFuture with our simple runner
//     println!("Running CounterFuture:");
//     let counter_future = CounterFuture::new(3);
//     let result = run_future(counter_future);
//     println!("CounterFuture result: {}", result);
//
//     // Note: The DelayFuture as written is better suited for a real async runtime.
//     // Its current implementation with thread::spawn and waker is how one might integrate
//     // blocking operations or external events into the async world.
// }
// To run the CounterFuture example, you can uncomment main and run_future.
// The DelayFuture is more illustrative of waker usage with external events.
```
*Self-correction:* The `DelayFuture` example above is a bit complex for a first manual future due to threading. The `CounterFuture` is simpler for demonstrating `poll` mechanics. The `DelayFuture` shows a more realistic scenario where a `Waker` is used to bridge an external event (timer completion) to the async task. A real `DelayFuture` would use the runtime's timer services (e.g., `tokio::time::sleep`).

**State Machines:**
Futures are often implemented as state machines. The `poll` method checks the current state and tries to advance it. If it can't advance to a final `Ready` state, it returns `Poll::Pending` and ensures a `Waker` is registered so it can be polled again when progress is possible.
The `enum DelayState` in the `DelayFuture` example illustrates this.

## 3. Async/Await Syntax

Rust provides syntactic sugar (`async` and `await`) to make writing asynchronous code feel more like writing synchronous code. The compiler transforms `async/await` code into state machines that implement the `Future` trait.

**`async` keyword:**
*   **`async fn`**:
    When you declare a function with `async fn`, it no longer directly returns its declared return type. Instead, it returns an anonymous type that implements `Future<Output = T>`, where `T` is the original declared return type.
    ```rust
    // This function:
    async fn get_data_async() -> String {
        // ... some asynchronous operations ...
        "Hello from async fn".to_string()
    }

    // Is roughly equivalent to (conceptual):
    // fn get_data_async_compiler_generated() -> impl Future<Output = String> {
    //     // Compiler generates a state machine struct:
    //     struct GetDataAsyncFuture {
    //         state: /* ... */,
    //         // ... fields to store local variables across .await points ...
    //     }
    //
    //     impl Future for GetDataAsyncFuture {
    //         type Output = String;
    //         fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
    //             // Logic to advance the state machine, poll sub-futures, etc.
    //             // If it encounters an .await, it polls the inner future.
    //             // If inner future is Pending, this future also becomes Pending,
    //             // ensuring the Waker is propagated.
    //             // If inner future is Ready, it uses the value and continues.
    //             // Eventually returns Poll::Ready("Hello from async fn".to_string())
    //         }
    //     }
    //
    //     GetDataAsyncFuture { /* initial state */ }
    // }
    ```
*   **`async` blocks**:
    You can create a future inline using an `async` block. This is useful for creating futures that capture variables from the surrounding scope.
    ```rust
    let name = "World";
    let my_future = async {
        // This block is a Future<Output = String>
        println!("Preparing greeting...");
        let greeting = format!("Hello, {}!", name); // `name` is captured
        // Simulate some async work
        // In a real scenario, this would be `some_other_future.await`
        // For now, let's use a placeholder that would require a runtime.
        // tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
        greeting
    };
    // `my_future` can now be .await'ed or passed to an executor.
    ```

**`.await` keyword:**
*   The `.await` operator is used to "pause" the execution of an `async` function or block until a future is `Ready`.
*   It can **only be used inside an `async fn` or an `async` block**.
*   When `.await` is used on a future:
    1.  The future is `poll`ed.
    2.  If it returns `Poll::Ready(value)`, then `value` becomes the result of the `.await` expression, and execution continues.
    3.  If it returns `Poll::Pending`, the current `async fn` itself "yields" control. It effectively returns `Poll::Pending` to its caller (the executor). The `Waker` from the context will have been passed to the sub-future, so when the sub-future is ready, the executor will be notified to poll the outer `async fn` again.
*   Crucially, `.await` **does not block the current thread**. It allows the executor to run other tasks while waiting.

```rust
async fn fetch_url(url: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    // Placeholder for an actual async HTTP GET request
    // In a real app, you'd use a library like `reqwest`
    println!("Fetching {}...", url);
    // Dummy future that resolves after a short delay (requires a runtime like tokio)
    // tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
    Ok(format!("Content from {}", url))
}

async fn get_two_pages() -> (String, String) {
    let page1_future = fetch_url("https://example.com");
    let page2_future = fetch_url("https://example.org");

    // .await will pause execution of get_two_pages here if page1_future is Pending
    let page1_content = page1_future.await.unwrap_or_default();
    println!("Got page 1");

    // .await will pause execution here if page2_future is Pending
    let page2_content = page2_future.await.unwrap_or_default();
    println!("Got page 2");

    (page1_content, page2_content)
}

// To run this, you need an executor. Example with tokio:
// #[tokio::main]
// async fn main() {
//     let (content1, content2) = get_two_pages().await;
//     println!("--- Results ---");
//     println!("Page 1: {}", content1);
//     println!("Page 2: {}", content2);
// }
```
In `get_two_pages`, `fetch_url("https://example.com").await` is called. If this future is `Pending`, `get_two_pages` itself becomes `Pending` and yields control to the executor. When the `fetch_url` future for `example.com` completes, the executor re-polls `get_two_pages`, which then resumes after the first `.await` and proceeds to `fetch_url("https://example.org").await`.

## 4. Executors and Runtimes

**The Need for an Executor:**
As mentioned, futures are lazy. Simply creating a future does nothing. An **executor** (or **async runtime**) is responsible for:
1.  Accepting top-level futures (often called "tasks").
2.  Polling them until they complete.
3.  Managing `Waker`s to efficiently re-poll futures that were `Pending`.

**What an Executor Does:**
*   **Task Management:** Maintains a collection of tasks (futures that need to be run).
*   **Polling Loop:** Continuously polls tasks that are ready to make progress.
*   **Waker Integration:** When a task's `poll` method returns `Poll::Pending` after registering a `Waker`, the executor waits. When an external event (like I/O readiness) happens, the associated `Waker` is called. This signals the executor to schedule the task for polling again.
*   **Thread Pool (Optional):** Many runtimes use a thread pool to execute tasks, potentially in parallel. This allows `async` code to benefit from multiple CPU cores, especially if tasks can be broken down or if `spawn_blocking` is used for CPU-bound work.
*   **I/O Reactor (Often):** Runtimes like `tokio` include an I/O reactor (e.g., using `epoll` on Linux, `kqueue` on macOS, IOCP on Windows) to efficiently manage non-blocking I/O operations and integrate them with `Waker`s.
*   **Timer Services:** Provide facilities for futures that need to complete after a delay (e.g., `tokio::time::sleep`).

**Popular Runtimes:**
*   **`tokio`**:
    *   Highly popular, feature-rich, and performance-oriented.
    *   Excellent for networking applications (built-in TCP/UDP, TLS, HTTP with `hyper`).
    *   Provides multi-threaded and current-thread executors.
    *   Offers utilities for timers, synchronization primitives (`Mutex`, `Semaphore`, channels), file system operations.
    *   Ecosystem: `hyper` (HTTP), `tonic` (gRPC), `reqwest` (HTTP client), `axum` (web framework).
*   **`async-std`**:
    *   Aims to provide async equivalents of `std` library APIs (e.g., `async_std::fs`, `async_std::net`).
    *
