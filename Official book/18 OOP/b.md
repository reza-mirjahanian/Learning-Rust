### **1. Introduction to OOP in Rust**
Rust is not a purely object-oriented language, but it supports OOP concepts through its unique features like **structs**, **traits**, and **enums**. Unlike languages with classes as the core of OOP, Rust uses a combination of data structures and behavior definitions to achieve similar goals. The key principles of OOP—**encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**—are implemented in Rust through:
- **Structs** for data encapsulation.
- **Traits** for defining shared behavior (similar to interfaces or abstract classes).
- **Enums** for representing variants (useful for polymorphism).

#### **Key Comparison with Traditional OOP Languages**
| **Aspect**                | **Rust**                              | **Java/C++ (Traditional OOP)**       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Basic Unit**            | Structs and Enums                    | Classes                              |
| **Inheritance**           | Via Traits (no direct inheritance)   | Via Class Hierarchies                |
| **Encapsulation**         | Struct fields with visibility        | Private/Public access specifiers     |
| **Polymorphism**          | Trait objects and generics           | Virtual functions and inheritance    |

Rust prioritizes **safety** and **zero-cost abstractions**, meaning you get OOP-like features without runtime overhead.

### **2. Foundational Concepts: Structs as the Building Blocks**
In Rust, **structs** are the primary way to define custom data types that bundle data together. They are the closest equivalent to classes in traditional OOP languages, though they lack direct inheritance.

#### **2.1 Defining a Struct**
A struct is defined using the `struct` keyword. Fields can have different visibility levels (e.g., `pub` for public access).

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,         // Private field
    pub age: u32,         // Public field
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: 30,
    };
    println!("Age: {}", person.age); // Works because age is public
    // println!("Name: {}", person.name); // Error: name is private
}
```

#### **2.2 Adding Behavior with `impl` Blocks**
Behavior (methods) is added to structs using `impl` blocks. Methods can take ownership of `self`, borrow `self` immutably (`&self`), or mutably (`&mut self`).

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    pub age: u32,
}

impl Person {
    // Constructor-like method (associated function)
    fn new(name: &str, age: u32) -> Person {
        Person {
            name: String::from(name),
            age,
        }
    }

    // Instance method (takes &self)
    fn get_name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.name
    }

    // Mutable method (takes &mut self)
    fn set_age(&mut self, new_age: u32) {
        self.age = new_age;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut person = Person::new("Alice", 30);
    println!("Name: {}", person.get_name()); // Access private field via method
    person.set_age(31);
    println!("Updated Age: {}", person.age);
}
```

#### **2.3 Encapsulation in Structs**
Encapsulation is achieved by controlling field visibility (`pub` vs. private). Private fields can only be accessed through public methods defined in `impl` blocks, ensuring data integrity.

#### **Edge Case: Struct Initialization with Default Values**
Rust doesn't have built-in default constructors, but you can use the `Default` trait to define default values.

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point::default(); // Initializes to (0, 0)
    println!("Point: ({}, {})", p.x, p.y);
}
```

---

### **3. Traits: Defining Shared Behavior (Inheritance and Polymorphism)**
Rust does not support traditional inheritance (i.e., subclassing), but it uses **traits** to define shared behavior across types. Traits are similar to interfaces in Java or abstract base classes in C++.

#### **3.1 Defining and Implementing a Trait**
A trait defines a set of methods that types can implement.

```rust
trait Speak {
    fn speak(&self) -> String;
}

struct Dog {
    name: String,
}

struct Cat {
    name: String,
}

impl Speak for Dog {
    fn speak(&self) -> String {
        format!("{} says Woof!", self.name)
    }
}

impl Speak for Cat {
    fn speak(&self) -> String {
        format!("{} says Meow!", self.name)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog { name: String::from("Buddy") };
    let cat = Cat { name: String::from("Whiskers") };
    println!("{}", dog.speak());
    println!("{}", cat.speak());
}
```

#### **3.2 Traits as Bounds for Polymorphism**
Traits can be used to enforce behavior on types in functions or generics, enabling **static polymorphism**.

```rust
fn make_sound<T: Speak>(animal: &T) {
    println!("{}", animal.speak());
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog { name: String::from("Buddy") };
    let cat = Cat { name: String::from("Whiskers") };
    make_sound(&dog);
    make_sound(&cat);
}
```

#### **3.3 Dynamic Polymorphism with Trait Objects**
For **dynamic dispatch** (runtime polymorphism), use trait objects with `dyn Trait`. This requires wrapping the type in a `Box`, `Rc`, or `Arc` since trait objects need a known size.

```rust
fn make_sound_dynamic(animal: &dyn Speak) {
    println!("{}", animal.speak());
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog { name: String::from("Buddy") };
    let cat = Cat { name: String::from("Whiskers") };
    let animals: Vec<Box<dyn Speak>> = vec![Box::new(dog), Box::new(cat)];
    for animal in animals {
        make_sound_dynamic(&*animal);
    }
}
```

#### **Comparison: Generics vs. Trait Objects**
| **Aspect**               | **Generics (Static Dispatch)**       | **Trait Objects (Dynamic Dispatch)** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Performance**          | Faster (monomorphization at compile time) | Slower (vtable lookup at runtime)    |
| **Flexibility**          | Limited to compile-time known types | Can handle heterogeneous types       |
| **Use Case**             | When types are known                 | When types are dynamic (e.g., collections of different types) |

#### **Edge Case: Trait Object Safety**
Not all traits can be used as trait objects. A trait must be **object-safe**, meaning:
- No generic methods.
- Methods must take `self` as a reference (e.g., `&self` or `&mut self`).

```rust
// This trait is not object-safe due to the static method
trait NotObjectSafe {
    fn static_method(); // Error if used as dyn NotObjectSafe
}
```

---

### **4. Enums for Polymorphic Behavior**
Rust's **enums** are powerful for representing different variants of a type, often used for polymorphism in a type-safe way.

#### **4.1 Basic Enum with Variants**
Enums can hold data in their variants, making them more powerful than simple enumerations in other languages.

```rust
enum Animal {
    Dog(String),
    Cat(String),
}

impl Animal {
    fn speak(&self) -> String {
        match self {
            Animal::Dog(name) => format!("{} says Woof!", name),
            Animal::Cat(name) => format!("{} says Meow!", name),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Animal::Dog(String::from("Buddy"));
    let cat = Animal::Cat(String::from("Whiskers"));
    println!("{}", dog.speak());
    println!("{}", cat.speak());
}
```

#### **4.2 Enums vs. Traits for Polymorphism**
- **Enums**: Best for a closed set of variants (e.g., fixed types like `Dog` and `Cat`).
- **Traits**: Best for an open set of types (e.g., allowing third-party types to implement behavior).

---

### **5. Encapsulation with Modules**
Rust uses **modules** to organize code and enforce encapsulation at a higher level. Modules control visibility using the `pub` keyword.

#### **5.1 Example of Module-Based Encapsulation**
```rust
mod animals {
    pub struct Dog {
        name: String, // Private field
    }

    impl Dog {
        pub fn new(name: &str) -> Dog {
            Dog { name: String::from(name) }
        }

        pub fn bark(&self) -> String {
            format!("{} barks!", self.name)
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = animals::Dog::new("Buddy");
    println!("{}", dog.bark());
    // dog.name; // Error: field is private
}
```

---

### **6. Advanced OOP Patterns in Rust**
Now that we've covered the basics, let's explore advanced patterns and use cases that emulate traditional OOP designs.

#### **6.1 Builder Pattern for Struct Initialization**
The builder pattern is useful for structs with many optional fields.

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: Option<u32>,
    address: Option<String>,
}

struct PersonBuilder {
    name: String,
    age: Option<u32>,
    address: Option<String>,
}

impl PersonBuilder {
    fn new(name: &str) -> PersonBuilder {
        PersonBuilder {
            name: String::from(name),
            age: None,
            address: None,
        }
    }

    fn age(mut self, age: u32) -> Self {
        self.age = Some(age);
        self
    }

    fn address(mut self, address: &str) -> Self {
        self.address = Some(String::from(address));
        self
    }

    fn build(self) -> Person {
        Person {
            name: self.name,
            age: self.age,
            address: self.address,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let person = PersonBuilder::new("Alice")
        .age(30)
        .address("123 Main St")
        .build();
    println!("Person: {:?}, Age: {:?}, Address: {:?}", person.name, person.age, person.address);
}
```

#### **6.2 Factory Pattern with Traits**
The factory pattern can be implemented using traits to create instances dynamically.

```rust
trait AnimalFactory {
    fn create_animal(&self, name: &str) -> Box<dyn Speak>;
}

struct DogFactory;

impl AnimalFactory for DogFactory {
    fn create_animal(&self, name: &str) -> Box<dyn Speak> {
        Box::new(Dog { name: String::from(name) })
    }
}

fn main() {
    let factory = DogFactory;
    let animal = factory.create_animal("Buddy");
    println!("{}", animal.speak());
}
```

#### **6.3 Edge Case: Ownership and Borrowing in OOP**
Rust's ownership model can complicate OOP designs. For instance, methods often need to borrow `self` to avoid moving data.

```rust
struct Owner {
    pet: Dog,
}

impl Owner {
    fn pet_speak(&self) {
        println!("{}", self.pet.speak()); // Borrow self immutably
    }
}

fn main() {
    let owner = Owner { pet: Dog { name: String::from("Buddy") } };
    owner.pet_speak();
}
```

If ownership is transferred, you must handle it explicitly, which can be a challenge compared to garbage-collected OOP languages.

---

### **7. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices**
- **Avoid Overusing Trait Objects**: They introduce runtime overhead. Prefer generics for better performance.
- **Leverage Ownership**: Design methods to use borrowing (`&self` or `&mut self`) unless ownership transfer is necessary.
- **Use Enums for Closed Sets**: If your types are fixed, enums are often more idiomatic than traits.
- **Modularize Code**: Use modules to encapsulate related structs and traits, improving readability and maintainability.

#### **Edge Case: Mutability Conflicts**
Rust's strict borrowing rules prevent multiple mutable references, which can be a hurdle in OOP designs.

```rust
struct MutableContainer {
    data: Vec<i32>,
}

impl MutableContainer {
    fn get_data(&self) -> &Vec<i32> {
        &self.data
    }

    fn modify_data(&mut self) {
        self.data.push(42);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut container = MutableContainer { data: vec![] };
    // let data = container.get_data(); // Error if uncommented: cannot borrow mutably later
    container.modify_data();
}
```

---

### **8. Comparing Rust OOP with Other Languages**
- **Rust vs. Java**: Java uses classes with direct inheritance, while Rust uses traits for composition over inheritance. Rust's ownership model adds safety but requires more explicit design.
- **Rust vs. C++**: C++ supports multiple inheritance and virtual functions, which can lead to complexity. Rust avoids these with traits and generics, prioritizing safety.
- **Rust vs. Python**: Python's dynamic typing and garbage collection make OOP simpler but less performant. Rust requires upfront design for ownership but ensures zero-cost abstractions.

---

### **9. Practical Project: Building a Small OOP System**
Let’s build a small simulation of a **Zoo Management System** to apply all concepts.

```rust
// Define a trait for animals
trait Animal {
    fn make_sound(&self) -> String;
    fn get_name(&self) -> &str;
}

// Struct for Lion
struct Lion {
    name: String,
}

impl Animal for Lion {
    fn make_sound(&self) -> String {
        format!("{} roars!", self.name)
    }

    fn get_name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.name
    }
}

// Struct for Elephant
struct Elephant {
    name: String,
}

impl Animal for Elephant {
    fn make_sound(&self) -> String {
        format!("{} trumpets!", self.name)
    }

    fn get_name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.name
    }
}

// Zoo struct to manage animals
struct Zoo {
    animals: Vec<Box<dyn Animal>>,
}

impl Zoo {
    fn new() -> Zoo {
        Zoo { animals: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_animal(&mut self, animal: Box<dyn Animal>) {
        self.animals.push(animal);
    }

    fn make_all_sound(&self) {
        for animal in &self.animals {
            println!("{}", animal.make_sound());
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut zoo = Zoo::new();
    zoo.add_animal(Box::new(Lion { name: String::from("Simba") }));
    zoo.add_animal(Box::new(Elephant { name: String::from("Dumbo") }));
    zoo.make_all_sound();
}
```

This project demonstrates:
- Traits for defining behavior.
- Dynamic polymorphism with trait objects.
- Encapsulation of data in structs.
- Managing a collection of heterogeneous types.

---

### **10. Advanced Topics for Mastery**
- **Associated Types in Traits**: Use associated types for more flexible trait designs.
  ```rust
  trait Container {
      type Item;
      fn get_item(&self) -> &Self::Item;
  }
  ```
- **Trait Bounds and Lifetimes**: Combine traits with lifetime annotations for complex designs.
- **Smart Pointers in OOP**: Use `Rc` or `Arc` for shared ownership in trait objects.
- **Crates for OOP**: Explore crates like `dyn-clone` for cloning trait objects or `derive_more` for deriving common traits.
