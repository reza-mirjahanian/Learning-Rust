# Lifetime Annotations in Rust

---

## **What are Lifetimes?**

- **Lifetimes** are Rust’s way of describing the scope for which a reference is valid.
- Prevents **dangling references** and **data races** at compile time.

---

## **Syntax**

```rust
&'a T
```
- `&` – reference
- `'a` – named lifetime
- `T` – referenced type

---

## **Lifetime Elision Rules**

Rust can infer lifetimes in many cases:

1. **Each elided lifetime in input position becomes a distinct lifetime parameter:**

   ```rust
   fn foo(x: &i32, y: &i32) -> &i32
   ```
   becomes
   ```rust
   fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> &i32
   ```

2. **If there is exactly one input lifetime, that lifetime is assigned to all elided output lifetimes:**

   ```rust
   fn foo(x: &i32) -> &i32
   ```
   becomes
   ```rust
   fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32
   ```

3. **If the method has `&self` or `&mut self`, the lifetime of self is assigned to all elided output lifetimes:**

   ```rust
   impl MyStruct {
       fn bar(&self, x: &i32) -> &i32
   }
   ```
   becomes
   ```rust
   impl MyStruct {
       fn bar<'a>(&'a self, x: &i32) -> &'a i32
   }
   ```

---

## **When to Specify Lifetimes**

- When you have **multiple references** and **Rust can't infer** which one lives longer.
- When **structs** or **enums** hold references.

---

## **Function Lifetime Annotations**

**General Form:**
```rust
fn function<'a>(x: &'a Type) -> &'a Type
```

**Example:**
```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}
```

---

## **Structs With Lifetimes**

**Syntax:**
```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    bar: &'a str,
}
```

- Every reference in a struct must have an explicit lifetime parameter if it’s not `'static`.

---

## **Enums With Lifetimes**

**Syntax:**
```rust
enum MyOption<'a, T> {
    Some(&'a T),
    None,
}
```

---

## **Lifetime Bounds in Traits & Generics**

**Trait Bounds:**
```rust
fn foo<T: 'a>(x: &'a T) {}
```
- `'a` is the **minimum** lifetime for `T`.

**Lifetime in Traits:**
```rust
trait MyTrait<'a> {
    fn bar(&'a self);
}
```

---

## **Static Lifetime `'static`**

- `'static` lives for the entire duration of the program.
- Used for string literals and global data.

```rust
static NAME: &'static str = "Rust";
```

---

## **Lifetime Subtyping**

- `'a: 'b` means `'a` **outlives** `'b`.
- Useful in generic constraints.

```rust
fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) where 'a: 'b {}
```

---

## **Lifetime Coercion**

- References with longer lifetimes can be coerced to shorter ones (never the reverse).

---

## **Common Lifetime Errors**

| Error Message                                               | Cause                                | Solution                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| borrowed value does not live long enough                    | Reference outlives its data          | Ensure data lives at least as long as the reference            |
| missing lifetime specifier                                 | Ambiguous reference lifetimes        | Add explicit lifetime annotations                              |
| cannot return reference to local variable                  | Returning reference to local data    | Return owned data or ensure reference is valid                 |
| conflicting lifetime requirements                          | Incompatible lifetimes               | Restructure code or add more specific annotations              |

---

## **Lifetime in Methods**

**With &self:**
```rust
impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
    fn bar(&self) -> &'a str {
        self.bar
    }
}
```

---

## **Lifetime in Closures**

- Lifetimes are usually inferred, but sometimes you need to help the compiler.

```rust
let r: &'a i32 = {
    let x = 5;
    &x // Error: x does not live long enough
};
```

---

## **Special Lifetime Cases**

**Higher-Ranked Trait Bounds (HRTBs):**
```rust
fn foo<F>(f: F) where F: for<'a> Fn(&'a i32) {}
```
- Means `F` can accept any lifetime for its reference.

---

## **Tips and Best Practices**

- **Prefer Owned Types:** Use `String` over `&str` if possible to avoid lifetimes.
- **Minimize Lifetime Scope:** Use the narrowest possible lifetime.
- **Use Lifetime Elision:** Let the compiler infer lifetimes when possible.
- **Avoid Overusing Lifetimes:** Sometimes `Clone`, `Rc`, or `Arc` is easier.
- **Understand Borrow Checker:** Errors often point to scope issues.
- **Refactor Large Functions:** Break functions to simplify lifetime relationships.

---

## **Advanced: Lifetime Parameters and Associated Types**

**Associated Types with Lifetimes:**
```rust
trait Foo {
    type Bar<'a>;
}
```

---

## **Useful Lifetime Patterns**

**Returning a reference tied to input:**
```rust
fn first<'a>(v: &'a [i32]) -> Option<&'a i32> {
    v.get(0)
}
```

**Struct borrowing data:**
```rust
struct Holder<'a> {
    data: &'a str,
}
```

**Nested Lifetimes:**
```rust
fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> &i32
    where 'a: 'b
{
    if true { x } else { y }
}
```
