### 1. **Basic Project Structure**

When you create a new Rust project using Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system), it sets up a basic structure for you:

```
my_project/
├── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.lock
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

- **`Cargo.toml`**: This file is where you specify your project’s metadata, dependencies, and configuration.
- **`Cargo.lock`**: This file records the exact versions of dependencies used, ensuring consistency across builds.
- **`src/main.rs`**: The entry point for a binary project. If it's a library, you would have `lib.rs` instead.

### 2. **Splitting Code into Modules**

Rust encourages modular design. You can split your code into multiple modules to improve organization:

- **`mod.rs`**: A module can be defined in a `mod.rs` file within a directory named after the module.
- **Inline Modules**: You can define modules directly in a file using the `mod` keyword.
- **File Modules**: Create a file named after the module, e.g., `foo.rs`, and declare it in the parent module with `mod foo;`.

Example structure with modules:

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   ├── foo.rs
│   └── bar/
│       └── mod.rs
```

### 3. **Using Libraries and Binaries**

A Rust package can contain both a library and multiple binaries:

- **Library**: Code that can be shared across binaries. Defined in `src/lib.rs`.
- **Binaries**: Separate entry points for different applications. Place additional binaries in the `src/bin/` directory.

Example:

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── bin/
│       ├── another_bin.rs
│       └── yet_another_bin.rs
```

### 4. **Dependencies and Features**

- **Dependencies**: Add external crates in `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`.
- **Features**: Use features to conditionally compile parts of your code. Define them in `Cargo.toml` under `[features]`.

Example `Cargo.toml` snippet:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"

[features]
default = ["serde"]
```

### 5. **Testing**

Rust has built-in support for testing. Organize your tests in:

- **Unit Tests**: Placed within the same file as the code they test, using the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute.
- **Integration Tests**: Placed in the `tests` directory. Each file in this directory is a separate test crate.

Example:

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs
└── tests/
    ├── integration_test.rs
    └── another_test.rs
```

### 6. **Documentation**

- **Comments**: Use `///` for documentation comments. They are used to generate HTML documentation with `cargo doc`.
- **README**: Include a `README.md` at the root for project overview and instructions.

### 7. **Build Scripts**

For custom build steps, use a `build.rs` file. This script runs before the package is built.

### 8. **Workspace**

For managing multiple related packages, use a workspace. Define it in a `Cargo.toml` at the root:

```
workspace/
├── Cargo.toml
├── package1/
│   └── Cargo.toml
└── package2/
    └── Cargo.toml
```

Root `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace]
members = ["package1", "package2"]
```

### 9. **Best Practices**

- **Keep it Simple**: Start with a simple structure and refactor as needed.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for files and modules.
- **Organize by Feature**: Group related functionalities together.
- **Limit Public API**: Expose only what's necessary in your library crate.

### 10. **Advanced Tools**

- **Clippy**: Use `cargo clippy` for linting and improving code quality.
- **Rustfmt**: Use `cargo fmt` for consistent code formatting.
