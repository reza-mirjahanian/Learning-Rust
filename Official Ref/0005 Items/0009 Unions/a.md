# Technical Reference Guide: **Unions in Rust**

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of unions in Rust, covering basic to advanced usage, internal mechanics, and practical considerations.

---

# 1. **What Are Unions in Rust?**

Unions in Rust, introduced in version 1.19.0, are similar to C-style unions: they allow you to define a single type that can store different data types in the same memory location. Only one variant of the union can be active at a time, and accessing a union's fields is inherently unsafe.

---

# 2. **Basic Definition and Usage**

Unions are defined using the `union` keyword, followed by a name and fields.

### Anatomy

```rust
union ExampleUnion {
    int_value: i32,
    float_value: f32,
}
```

Here’s a breakdown:
- `int_value` and `float_value` share the same memory space.
- Like structs, fields in a union are named with types.
- Accessing fields is always **unsafe**, as Rust cannot guarantee type correctness.

### Example: Declaring and Using a Union

```rust
union MyUnion {
    int_val: i32,
    float_val: f32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut u = MyUnion { int_val: 10 };
    
    unsafe {
        // Access the value
        println!("int_val: {}", u.int_val); 
        
        // Overwrite with a different type
        u.float_val = 3.14;
        // Access the overwritten field
        println!("float_val: {}", u.float_val);
    }
}
```

### Key Features
- **Memory-efficient representation**: Useful for low-level programming or FFI (Foreign Function Interface) with C-like libraries.
- **Unsafe access**: You must ensure that you do not access invalid memory or interpret data incorrectly.

---

# 3. **Field Attributes and Modifiers**

Fields in a union behave similarly to struct fields but have stricter rules due to unsafe access requirements. They inherit the following modifiers:

1. **Visibility Modifiers**: Fields can be `pub`, `crate`, or private (`default`).
    - Example:
      ```rust
      union MyUnion {
          pub int_val: i32,       // Publicly accessible
          private_val: f64,      // Private by default
      }
      ```

2. **Default Value**: Unions cannot have fields with default values or constant initializations.

---

# 4. **Memory Representation**

### Unions Are Never Zero-Initialized
Union data must be explicitly set before accessing it. The compiler does not automatically initialize union fields.

### Layout
- All fields of a union share the same memory location.
- The memory size of a union is defined by the largest field.
- Memory alignment matches the highest alignment requirement among the fields.

#### Example: Memory Representation

```rust
union ExampleUnion {
    a: u8,    // 1 byte
    b: u32,   // 4 bytes
}
```

- The memory size of `ExampleUnion` will be 4 bytes (from `u32`, the largest field). 
- The alignment will also be `u32`'s alignment, which is 4 bytes.

#### Using `std::mem` to Inspect Memory Details

```rust
use std::mem;

union MyUnion {
    val_a: u8,
    val_b: u32,
}

fn main() {
    println!("Size: {}", mem::size_of::<MyUnion>());  // 4
    println!("Alignment: {}", mem::align_of::<MyUnion>());  // 4
}
```

---

# 5. **Safety and Edge Cases**

Accessing fields of a union is inherently unsafe and may lead to **undefined behavior (UB)** if certain rules are violated.

### Safety Rules
1. **Field Validity**: You must know which field contains a valid value.
2. **Active Field**: Only access the field that was last written to. Accessing a different field can lead to UB.
    - Example:
        ```rust
        union MyUnion {
            a: u32,
            b: f32,
        }

        let u = MyUnion { a: 42 };
        unsafe {
            println!("{}", u.b); // UB: accessing `b`, but `a` was set
        }
        ```

3. **Drop Handling**:
    - If a union field has a type that implements `Drop`, manually dropping the field is necessary.
    - Example:
      ```rust
      union MyUnion {
          a: String,  // Implements `Drop`
          b: i32,
      }
      
      fn main() {
          let u = MyUnion { a: String::from("Hello") };
          unsafe {
              std::mem::drop(u.a);  // Explicit manual drop
          }
      }
      ```

---

# 6. **Advanced Features**

### `repr(C)` Attribute
Unions default to Rust's representation (`repr(Rust)`), which does not guarantee layout or alignment compatibility with other languages. Use `#[repr(C)]` for FFI compatibility.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
union MyUnion {
    int_val: i32,
    float_val: f32,
}
```

- Ensures that the layout matches C-style unions for interoperability with foreign functions.

---

### `repr` Attributes and Alignment

Other `repr` attributes can also be used:
- `repr(align(n))`: Custom alignment.
- `repr(packed)`: Reduces padding.

**Example of custom alignment**:

```rust
#[repr(C, align(8))]
union MyUnion {
    a: u8,
    b: u64,
}

fn main() {
    println!("Alignment: {}", std::mem::align_of::<MyUnion>()); // 8
}
```

---

### Type Inference in Unions
Rust does not infer types for union fields. You must explicitly cast when accessing through a pointer.

```rust
union MyUnion {
    val: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let u = MyUnion { val: 42 };
    let ptr: *const u32 = unsafe { &u.val };
    println!("Pointer value: {}", unsafe { *ptr });
}
```

---

# 7. **Limitations and Gotchas**

### 1. Partial Initialization
Unions do not track which field is currently "active." You are responsible for ensuring correctness.

### 2. `Copy` and `Drop`
- A union can only implement `Copy` if **all fields of the union implement Copy.**
- Dropping unions directly is disallowed if any field implements `Drop`.

```rust
union MyUnion {
    a: u32,
    b: String,  // `String` implements `Drop`
}
```

### 3. Recursive Unions
Unions cannot include themselves recursively.

---

# 8. **Visibility and Scoping**

Visibility modifiers apply to unions in the same way as structs and enums:

- `pub`: Makes the union accessible outside the crate.
- Default (private): Accessible only within the current module.

Example:

```rust
mod my_mod {
    pub union PublicUnion {
        pub field: i32,
        private_field: f64,
    }
    
    union PrivateUnion {
        field: i32,
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Can access PublicUnion but not PrivateUnion
    let u = my_mod::PublicUnion { field: 42 };
    unsafe {
        println!("Field: {}", u.field);  // Accessible
    }
}
```

# 10. **Practical Tips and Tricks**

### 1. **Using `MaybeUninit` for Untyped Initialization**
`std::mem::MaybeUninit` can safely initialize components that don’t implement `Default`.

```rust
use std::mem::MaybeUninit;

union MyUnion {
    a: u32,
    b: f64,
}

fn main() {
    let u = MaybeUninit::<MyUnion>::uninit();
    let union = unsafe { u.assume_init() }; // Safe initialization
}
```

### 2. **Efficient Data Representation**
Unions are often used in parsers, interpreters, or FFI contexts to convert between multiple types.

---

# 11. **Conclusion**

Rust unions are powerful, low-level constructs primarily used for FFI and memory-efficient design. However, their use comes with significant safety requirements and a need for the programmer to control memory layout and access carefully. By ensuring these practices, unions can simplify complex data representations while maintaining minimal memory overhead.
