# Rust Enums: A Comprehensive Reference

**Enums** in Rust are *algebraic data types* (tagged unions) that let you define a type by enumerating its possible *variants*. Each variant can be **unit-like** (no data), **tuple-like** (unnamed fields), or **struct-like** (named fields). For example, consider the following enum with all three kinds of variants:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,                           // unit-like (no data)
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },        // struct-like (named fields)
    Write(String),                 // tuple-like (one unnamed field)
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),    // tuple-like (multiple unnamed fields)
}
```

Here, `Quit` carries no data, `Move` has two named fields, `Write` carries a `String`, and `ChangeColor` carries three `i32`s. This effectively groups together several different “struct definitions” under one type: as one source notes, *“defining an enum with variants like these is similar to defining different struct definitions, except the enum groups them under one name”*. Rust’s type system is algebraic: product types are structs/tuples, and **sum types** (coproducts) are enums. In other words, an enum instance can be *exactly one* of its variants at a time.

Variants automatically act as *constructor functions*. For instance, `Message::Move { x: 10, y: 20 }` and `Message::ChangeColor(255, 255, 0)` both create `Message` values. In fact, each variant name is a function: for example, defining `enum IpAddr { V4(String), V6(String) }` implicitly provides `IpAddr::V4(addr)` and `IpAddr::V6(addr)` as constructors. Enums can also be generic (e.g. `enum Option<T> { None, Some(T) }`) and can have associated discriminants or `#[repr]` attributes (for instance, C-style enums or fixed-size representations).

## Pattern Matching with Enums

A primary use of enums is with **pattern matching**. The `match` expression allows you to branch on each variant, and the compiler enforces *exhaustiveness*: you must cover every variant (or include a wildcard `_`). For example:

```rust
match msg {
    Message::Quit => println!("Quit variant"),
    Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Moving to ({}, {})", x, y),
    Message::Write(text) => println!("Text message: {}", text),
    Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Change color to RGB({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
}
```

Rust checks that all four cases of `Message` are handled (or else the code won’t compile). This ensures *type-safe* and exhaustive handling of all variants.

For simpler cases, **`if let`** can be used to match one pattern conveniently. For example, instead of a full `match`, you can write `if let Message::Quit = msg { /* ... */ }`. This reads “if `msg` destructures into `Message::Quit`, run this block”. You can also use `else` and `else if let` with `if let` to handle other cases. Likewise, **`while let`** loops as long as a pattern matches, e.g. `while let Some(i) = optional_value { /* use i */ optional_value = None; }`.

Rust also provides the `matches!` macro to test a pattern: for instance, `matches!(v, Some(_))` returns `true` if `v` is `Some(...)`. This is equivalent to checking if a value matches a pattern, but in expression form. In summary:

* **`match`**: exhaustive pattern matching on enums (compiler checks all variants).
* **`if let`**: shorter syntax to match a single variant (optional `else`).
* **`while let`**: loop while a pattern holds.
* **`matches!` macro**: returns `true` if a value fits a pattern.

Each of these works seamlessly with enums, allowing you to destructure and handle variant data.

## Associated Methods on Enums

Enums, like structs, can have associated functions and methods via `impl`. Inside an `impl EnumName { ... }` block, you can define methods taking `&self`, and associated (static) functions. For example:

```rust
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

impl Color {
    // an associated function (constructor-like)
    fn from_name(name: &str) -> Option<Color> {
        match name {
            "red" => Some(Color::Red),
            "green" => Some(Color::Green),
            "blue" => Some(Color::Blue),
            _ => None,
        }
    }

    // an instance method
    fn is_primary(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(self, Color::Red | Color::Green | Color::Blue)
    }
}

let c = Color::from_name("red").unwrap();
println!("{}", c.is_primary());  // true
```

Here `Color::from_name` is an associated function (no `&self`), and `is_primary` is a method on `Color`. As one resource explains, *“to call functions on an enum, use an `impl` block; these functions are called methods.”*. In usage, you can invoke methods on enum values just like on structs: for example, if `m` is a `Message` enum, and `impl Message { fn call(&self) { ... } }` was defined, you can do `m.call()`.

Additionally, each variant name is effectively an *associated constructor*. As noted in Rust’s documentation, *“the name of each variant also becomes a function that constructs an instance of the enum.”*. This means you can write e.g. `IpAddr::V4("127.0.0.1".to_string())` to create an `IpAddr` enum, without needing a special `new` function.

## Using Enums in Structs, Traits, and Generics

Enums can be used anywhere a type is needed, including as fields in structs or as generic parameters. For example, you might have:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum AnimalKind { Cat, Dog }

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Animal {
    kind: AnimalKind,
    age: u8,
}

let pet = Animal { kind: AnimalKind::Cat, age: 3 };
println!("{:?}", pet);
```

This shows an enum (`AnimalKind`) being used as a field type in a struct. Enums can also implement traits just like any other type. In fact, standard enums like `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` are generic and implement many common traits. For instance, `enum Option<T> { None, Some(T) }` is generic in `T`, and it implements `Clone`, `Debug`, `Copy` (when `T: Copy`), and other traits. Similarly, `enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E) }` implements traits like `Clone`, `Debug`, `Eq`, etc., based on its parameters.

You can also define your own generic enums:

```rust
enum Tree<T> {
    Leaf(T),
    Node(Box<Tree<T>>, Box<Tree<T>>),
}
```

This `Tree<T>` is a recursive enum (see below) with generic type `T`. Enums are often used with trait bounds in generics (e.g. `impl<T: Debug> Debug for MyEnum<T> { ... }`) or used with generic data (as with `Option<T>` or `Result<T,E>`). In summary, enums work seamlessly with Rust’s generics and trait system, and can appear as types inside structs, traits, or other enums.

## Enum vs Struct: When to Use Which

**Structs** and **enums** both let you create custom types, but their use cases differ. A struct is a *product type*: it bundles a fixed set of fields together, all of which are always present. An enum is a *sum type*: a value is *one of* several variants, each possibly with different data. In practice:

* Use a **struct** when you have one concept with multiple properties. All fields coexist, and you access them by name (e.g. `Point { x: f64, y: f64 }`). Structs model “and” relationships (this object has this data).
* Use an **enum** when you have distinct alternatives or cases. Only one variant is present at a time. For example, an enum can model a response that could be either text, a number, or binary data, each with different fields. Enums model “or” relationships (this value is one of these variants).

As noted earlier, defining an enum with multiple variants is like defining several structs but grouping them under one type. For example, instead of separate types `Quit`, `Move`, `Write`, `ChangeColor`, we have one `Message` enum with those variants. Structs are ideal for fixed records, enums for tagged unions or variant types.

**Use cases differ**: Structs for composite objects; enums for *one-of-many* scenarios (state machines, AST nodes, optional values, error types, etc.). In short, if you find yourself defining many related structs with different fields, consider if they could be variants of an enum instead.

## Enum vs Union vs ADT

Rust’s **enum** is a *safe tagged union* (an algebraic sum type). Each enum value carries a discriminant (tag) telling which variant it is, plus the variant’s data. By contrast, a Rust `union` is an *unsafe untagged union* (like a C union) where multiple fields share the same memory and there is no built-in tag. Accessing a union field requires `unsafe` code, because Rust cannot check at runtime which field is active. As one Rust author put it, *“Rust enums are a form of tagged unions. Rust unions are plain old unions used for C interop; using them requires unsafe code.”*.

In C/C++, `enum` is just named integer constants (no data payload), and `union` is an untagged union (overlapping memory). Rust’s enum is more powerful: it is an *algebraic data type* (sum of product types) with pattern matching. In type theory, an ADT combines sum and product types. Structs and tuples are “product types” (like Cartesian product of fields), and enums are “sum types” (choosing one variant).

**Scenarios**:

* **Rust `enum`**: Use for variant cases, safe pattern matching, when you want exhaustiveness checking.
* **Rust `union`**: Rarely used; for low-level interop or memory optimizations where you manage the tag manually.
* **C/C++ `enum`**: Use for simple constant values (they become integers).
* **Java `enum`**: A special class of fixed instances (with possible methods/fields), not a sum type.
* **TypeScript `enum`**: A compile-time feature for named numeric or string constants, not a tagged union.

In summary, Rust’s `enum` acts like the safe “tagged union” found in functional languages, whereas C/C++ unions and enums are more primitive.

## Advanced Usage

**Recursive enums.** Enums can be recursive, but you must box the recursive part to give it a known size. For example, a linked list:

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),  // `Box` gives List a finite size
    Nil,
}
```

Without the `Box`, `Cons(i32, List)` would be infinitely large. As the Rust book shows, using `Box` *“breaks the infinite size”* of a recursive enum. In this example, `Cons` holds an `i32` and a pointer to another `List`. This pattern (or using `Rc`, `Arc`) is common for tree and list structures.

**Enums with lifetimes.** Enums can have lifetime parameters like any generic type. For instance:

```rust
enum RefOrString<'a> {
    Borrowed(&'a str),
    Owned(String),
}
```

Here `RefOrString<'a>` has a variant borrowing a `&'a str` and one owning a `String`. You just add a lifetime like `<T>` in a generic.

**Exhaustive vs Non-exhaustive enums.** By default, all enum variants are known and matchable. When you `match` an enum, you handle every variant or use `_`. Rust 1.40+ introduced `#[non_exhaustive]` to prevent exhaustive matching outside the defining crate. On a `#[non_exhaustive] enum`, external code must include a wildcard arm. The Rust reference explains that `#[non_exhaustive]` “indicates that a type or variant may have more fields or variants added in the future”. Outside the defining crate, you **cannot** match without a catch-all. As one source notes, *“when `#[non_exhaustive]` is applied to enums, it forces clients to handle a wildcard variant”*. Use this attribute for forward compatibility when defining library enums, at the cost of requiring `_ => {}` in external matches.

**Zero-variant enums (uninhabited).** It’s even possible to define `enum Never {}` with no variants. This type has no possible values (like the `!` type). It can never be instantiated, and is sometimes used as a “never” or unreachable type. These exist but are rarely used.

In summary, advanced enum usage includes recursive definitions (with indirection), lifetimes/generics, and the `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute. Recursive enums often require `Box` or other pointer types to work. The `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute, documented in the Rust reference, ensures that matches must include a wildcard for future variants.

## Common Enum Types in Rust

Rust’s standard library provides many useful enums. Three important ones are:

* **`Option<T>`**: Represents an optional value. Defined as

  ```rust
  pub enum Option<T> { None, Some(T) }
  ```

. `Option<T>` is used instead of null: `Some(value)` holds a `T`, and `None` means no value. For example:

```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);
if let Some(v) = x {
    println!("Value is {}", v);
} else {
    println!("No value");
}
```

Common methods include `.is_some()`, `.unwrap_or()`, `.map()`, etc. Note that `Option` has niche optimizations: e.g. `Option<&T>` is as small as a single pointer, using null as the `None` case.

* **`Result<T, E>`**: Used for error handling. Defined as

  ```rust
  pub enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E) }
  ```

. Here `Ok(v)` means success with value `v: T`, and `Err(e)` means failure with error `e: E`. Typical use:

```rust
fn parse_number(s: &str) -> Result<i32, std::num::ParseIntError> {
    let n = s.parse::<i32>()?; // returns Err early if parse fails
    Ok(n * 2)
}
```

You can match on a `Result` or use the `?` operator to propagate errors. Standard library and many crates use `Result<T, E>` extensively for fallible functions.

* **`Ordering`**: Defined in `std::cmp` as

  ```rust
  #[repr(i8)]
  pub enum Ordering { Less = -1, Equal = 0, Greater = 1, }
  ```

. This enum is returned by comparisons (`x.cmp(&y)`) and has methods like `.is_lt()`. You use it in sorting or comparison logic, e.g.

```rust
match x.cmp(&y) {
    Ordering::Less    => println!("x < y"),
    Ordering::Equal   => println!("x == y"),
    Ordering::Greater=> println!("x > y"),
}
```

Each of these common enums is an example of using enums for practical patterns: `Option` for nullability, `Result` for errors, and `Ordering` for comparisons.

## Error Handling with Enums

Rust’s error handling idiom centers on the `Result<T, E>` enum. Functions return `Result<T, E>`, using `Ok(value)` for success or `Err(error)` for failure. The caller typically uses `match`, `if let`, or the `?` operator to handle errors. For example:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;

fn read_username(path: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    let mut f = File::open(path)?;         // returns Err if file cannot be opened
    let mut s = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut s)?;             // returns Err if read fails
    Ok(s)
}
```

Here each `?` either unwraps `Ok` or returns `Err` early.

It is also common to define a custom error enum for a library or application:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum AppError {
    Io(std::io::Error),
    ParseInt(std::num::ParseIntError),
    // ... other error cases
}

impl std::fmt::Display for AppError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
        match self {
            AppError::Io(e) => write!(f, "I/O error: {}", e),
            AppError::ParseInt(e) => write!(f, "Parse error: {}", e),
        }
    }
}

impl std::error::Error for AppError {}
```

This enum lets you unify multiple error sources into one type, which can then be used as `Result<T, AppError>`. (Crates like `thiserror` can auto-derive these implementations for you.) In all cases, enums provide a clear way to represent error cases and handle them. The standard `Result` itself is defined as an enum and is the core of Rust’s error paradigm.

## Comparison with Other Languages

Rust’s `enum` is often compared to other languages’ enums:

* **C/C++**: An `enum` is just a set of integer constants (no data payload). In Rust terms, that’s akin to a field-less, unit-only enum. As one Rust developer points out, *“Rust’s enums are far more than just numbers. They’re closer to a tagged union than an enum, in C terms.”*. In C/C++, unions allow overlapping fields but no safety, whereas Rust’s enums always carry a discriminant to track the active variant.

* **Java**: Java `enum` types are class-like: each variant is a singleton object and you can attach methods/fields to the enum. They have fixed, ordered instances. Rust’s enums are more like algebraic data types and support data payload in variants. As one Java tutorial notes, *“a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class”*. So Java enums are classes with fixed instances, whereas Rust enums are sum types with explicit variants.

* **TypeScript**: TS enums (numeric or string) are essentially syntactic sugar for objects mapping names to values. The TypeScript handbook says *“Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants… TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums”*. Unlike Rust’s enums, they don’t have pattern matching or associated data (they compile to simple values or objects). They are more like C-style enums and do not form ADTs.

In summary, Rust’s enums generalize and extend these concepts. They combine the safety and flexibility of tagged unions (and ADTs in functional languages) rather than the limited enums of C++ or the constant sets of Java/TypeScript.

| **Pros**                                                                                                                                    | **Cons**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| • **Type-safe and expressive**: Enums encode state clearly and the compiler enforces exhaustive handling of cases.                          | • **Memory overhead**: The size of an enum is the size of its largest variant plus space for a tag (discriminant). For example, an enum with a 16-byte variant will be 24 bytes (including an 8-byte discriminant). This can waste memory if one variant is much larger. |
| • **Pattern matching**: `match`/`if let` allow concise destructuring of variants. Code can be very clear and maintainable.                  | • **Performance (branching)**: Matching on an enum may compile into a branch or jump table, which is usually fast but could be slightly slower than simple data access. Very large enums might lead to deeper match code (though the compiler optimizes it).             |
| • **Single type, many cases**: Groups related data shapes under one name (contrast multiple structs). Useful for state machines, ASTs, etc. | • **Inflexible in signatures**: Adding a new variant is a breaking change for external code unless `#[non_exhaustive]` is used. Exhaustive `match` must then be updated, or `_` arm used. Non-exhaustive enums force wildcard handling.                                  |
| • **Derivable traits and methods**: Can easily `#[derive]` traits like `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, etc.                                  | • **No direct field access**: Cannot do `e.field` on a variant; you must destructure (e.g. with `match` or `if let`). This is by design (variant could be different type), so it requires pattern handling.                                                              |
| • **ADT capability**: Supports complex data (tuple/struct variants), recursive types (with indirection), and enums with lifetimes/generics. | • **Exhaustiveness**: While usually an advantage, requiring exhaustiveness (no default case) can be verbose if you only care about one variant. (Use `_` or `if let` in that case.)                                                                                      |

## Performance Implications

Rust enums are very efficient in most cases, but there are trade-offs:

* **Size**: As noted, an enum’s memory size is determined by its largest variant plus the discriminant. For instance, if one variant contains a large array or struct, every enum value reserves that space. However, Rust applies *niche optimizations* in some cases (e.g. `Option<&T>` can be the size of one pointer). The reference confirms the 8-byte discriminant: *“The size of the enum is 24 bytes. The extra 8 bytes are used to store a 64-bit discriminant…”* in the `Number` example.

* **Tag representation**: By default, the discriminant is typically a machine word (e.g. 8 bytes on 64-bit), but the compiler may choose a smaller tag if possible, or optimize it away entirely in single-variant or niche cases.

* **Pattern matching cost**: In machine code, `match` on an enum usually becomes a sequence of branches (if-else) or a jump table based on the discriminant. This is generally very fast (constant-time branching). Only in extreme cases with hundreds of variants might you notice overhead. The example flowchart (omitted) shows an efficient branching structure. In practice, pattern matching on enums is optimized, so the performance cost is comparable to match on integer tags.

* **`#[repr]` attributes**: You can influence layout with `#[repr(u8)]`, `#[repr(C)]`, etc. For `repr(u8)`, Rust enforces that discriminants fit `u8`; overflow is an error. For `repr(C)`, be careful: it’s only well-defined for fieldless (C-like) enums, otherwise layout is unspecified.

Overall, enums are generally efficient. The main consideration is memory size if variants carry large data. Choose representations (`#[repr]`) or containers (e.g. `Box`) accordingly.

## Enum Derives and Attributes

Rust lets you annotate enums with attributes for added functionality:

* **`#[derive(...)]`**: Common derives on enums include `Debug`, `Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`, `Hash`, etc. For example, `#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]` automatically implements those traits if possible.

* **`#[repr(...)]`**: You can specify the memory representation.

  * `#[repr(u8)]`, `#[repr(i32)]`, etc. set the underlying integer type of the discriminant. If you explicitly assign values, they must fit the type. An overflow (e.g. setting 256 on `repr(u8)`) is a compile-time error.
  * `#[repr(C)]` on an enum makes it a C-style enum (with a guaranteed layout) but only safely applies to field-less enums or single-variant enums. With fields, it’s complex or invalid.
  * For **unit-only enums** (no data), you can cast to integer: e.g.

    ```rust
    enum Enum { A, B, C }
    assert_eq!(0, Enum::A as isize);
    ```

    This works because an untagged enum’s variants start at 0 by default. With explicit `repr(u8)` and values, you can control casting results, as shown in \[81].

* **`#[non_exhaustive]`**: As discussed, marking an enum or its variants with `#[non_exhaustive]` means more variants/fields may be added later. It forces matches to include a wildcard arm if used outside the defining crate.

* **Serde attributes**: (see next section) can be applied here too.

In short, use `#[derive]` for common traits, `#[repr]` to control layout, and `#[non_exhaustive]` for forward compatibility. Always heed Rust’s rules on these attributes to avoid layout or exhaustiveness issues.

## Serialization with Serde

The `serde` library provides powerful support for serializing/deserializing enums. By default (externally tagged), an enum instance is serialized as an object with the variant name as the key. For example:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum Message {
    Request { id: String, body: String },
    Response { id: String, result: i32 },
}
```

By default, `Message::Request { id, body }` serializes to JSON like `{"Request": {"id":"1","body":"..."}}`. This externally-tagged form works for all variant types (struct-like, tuple-like, unit).

Serde also supports other representations:

* **Internally tagged** (`#[serde(tag = "type")]`): The JSON has a field for the variant. Using the same `Message` with `#[serde(tag = "type")]` yields `{"type":"Request","id":"1","body":"..."}`. The tag field sits alongside the data fields.

* **Adjacently tagged** (`#[serde(tag = "t", content = "c")]`): The JSON has separate fields for tag and content, e.g. `{"t":"Request","c":{...}}`.

* **Untagged** (`#[serde(untagged)]`): No explicit tag is emitted. Serde tries each variant in order. For example, `enum Number { Int(i32), Text(String) }` could deserialize from `42` as `Int(42)` or `"hello"` as `Text("hello")`.

Each style has use cases. Externally tagged (the default) is widely compatible. Internally or adjacently tagged are useful for certain JSON schema conventions. Untagged enums let you accept multiple JSON shapes (at a cost of ambiguity). In all cases, you use `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` on the enum (and any nested types) to enable it.

## Tricky Parts and Gotchas

* **Exhaustiveness**: By default you must handle all variants in a `match`. Forgetting one is a compile error. Conversely, using `_` to catch all can hide a new variant if added later. The `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute forces a wildcard arm, which can lead to unreachable code if not careful.

* **Memory Layout**: As noted, enum size is determined by the largest variant. If one variant holds a large struct or array, every enum value will reserve that space (plus tag). Be mindful of variant payload sizes. For example, a large vector variant makes the enum large even when holding a small variant.

* **No direct field access**: You cannot do `e.x` on an enum `e`; you must destructure it. For example, with `Animal::Cat { name, weight }`, you cannot write `cat.weight` without matching. As explained on forums, Rust *“cannot guarantee an `Animal` is of type `Cat`,”* so field access requires `match` or `if let`. This often puzzles newcomers.

* **Pattern matches with `#[non_exhaustive]`**: When matching a non-exhaustive enum outside its crate, you must use a wildcard (`_`) to be exhaustive. Otherwise the code won’t compile.

* **Large number of variants**: Having dozens of variants can make code harder to read and can lead to large `match` blocks. In extreme cases, it might be better to refactor into sub-enums or structs.

* **`#[repr(C)]`**: If you try `#[repr(C)]` on an enum with data variants, remember Rust’s layout is not fully defined in that case. It’s safe only for field-less or single-field variants to interoperate with C.

Despite these gotchas, Rust’s compiler errors are usually informative (e.g. “pattern `X` not covered”), and the borrow checker ensures enum data is used safely. Once you get familiar with matching and variants, enums become a powerful tool with few pitfalls.
