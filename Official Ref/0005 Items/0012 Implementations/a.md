# Basics of `impl`

In Rust, `impl` blocks are used to define implementations â€” methods, associated functions, or trait implementations â€” for a type.

### Basic Syntax:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }

    fn translate(&mut self, dx: i32, dy: i32) {
        self.x += dx;
        self.y += dy;
    }
}
```

---

# Associated Functions and Methods

## Associated Functions (no `self`)

These do not operate on an instance.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn origin() -> Self {
        Self { x: 0, y: 0 }
    }
}
```

Usage:

```rust
let p = Point::origin();
```

---

## Methods (`self`, `&self`, `&mut self`)

Operate on an instance.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn magnitude(&self) -> f64 {
        ((self.x.pow(2) + self.y.pow(2)) as f64).sqrt()
    }

    fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.x = 0;
        self.y = 0;
    }
}
```

Notice:

* `self` â†’ takes ownership
* `&self` â†’ immutable borrow
* `&mut self` â†’ mutable borrow

---

## Multiple `impl` blocks

You can split methods into several `impl` blocks.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn sum(&self) -> i32 {
        self.x + self.y
    }
}

impl Point {
    fn difference(&self) -> i32 {
        self.x - self.y
    }
}
```

---

# Attributes and Modifiers on `impl`

You can apply **attributes** directly to `impl` blocks:

| Attribute           | Purpose                  | Example                                  |
| :------------------ | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `#[inline]`         | Hint for inlining        | `#[inline] fn foo() {}`                  |
| `#[inline(always)]` | Stronger inlining hint   |                                          |
| `#[inline(never)]`  | Prevent inlining         |                                          |
| `#[doc(hidden)]`    | Hide from documentation  |                                          |
| `#[cfg(...)]`       | Conditional compilation  | `#[cfg(feature = "extra")] impl Foo {}`  |
| `#[must_use]`       | Warn if result is unused | `#[must_use] fn compute() -> Result<()>` |

Example with `cfg`:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "debug")]
impl Point {
    fn debug_print(&self) {
        println!("Point: ({}, {})", self.x, self.y);
    }
}
```

---

# Visibility Rules

## `pub` in `impl`

The `impl` itself is never `pub` â€” only methods can be.

```rust
impl Point {
    pub fn visible_fn(&self) {}

    fn private_fn(&self) {}
}
```

| Item           | Visibility               |
| :------------- | :----------------------- |
| `impl Point`   | scoped to the crate      |
| `pub fn foo()` | publicly visible         |
| `fn bar()`     | crate-private by default |

---

# Advanced Usage: Traits and Blanket Implementations

## Trait Implementation

```rust
trait Drawable {
    fn draw(&self);
}

impl Drawable for Point {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing at ({}, {})", self.x, self.y);
    }
}
```

---

## Default Methods in Traits

```rust
trait Movable {
    fn move_by(&mut self, dx: i32, dy: i32);

    fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.move_by(-self.x(), -self.y());
    }

    fn x(&self) -> i32;
    fn y(&self) -> i32;
}
```

---

## Blanket Implementations

Implement a trait for *any* type matching a condition.

```rust
impl<T: Clone> MyTrait for T {
    fn my_func(&self) {
        println!("I'm a cloneable type!");
    }
}
```

**Common in `std`**, e.g., all `T: Display` have `ToString` automatically.

---

# Internal Memory Layout Details

* Methods are **not stored** with the struct.
* **Zero-cost abstractions**: method calls are either inlined or resolved at compile-time unless using dynamic dispatch (`dyn Trait`).

Example:

```rust
let p = Point::new(1, 2);
// p.magnitude() â†’ compiled as a direct call, no virtual function table (vtable)
```

---

# Edge Cases, Gotchas, and Lesser-Known Features

### 1. Overlapping `impl` blocks

```rust
impl Point {
    fn foo() {}
}

impl Point {
    fn foo() {} // Error: duplicate method name
}
```

You **cannot** define methods with the same name in separate `impl`s.

---

### 2. Orphan Rule

You can only `impl` a trait for a type if either the trait or the type is local to your crate.

```rust
// Bad: both `Vec` and `Display` are external
// impl Display for Vec<u8> {} // ERROR
```

---

### 3. Negative trait implementations (`impl !Trait`)

You can opt a type **out** of a trait.

```rust
#![feature(negative_impls)]

struct MyType;

impl !Send for MyType {}
```

(Stable soon; nightly as of 2025)

---

### 4. Specialization

Allows more specific trait impls to override generic ones.

```rust
#![feature(specialization)]

trait Print {
    fn print(&self);
}

impl<T> Print for T {
    default fn print(&self) { println!("Default!"); }
}

impl Print for u32 {
    fn print(&self) { println!("u32: {}", self); }
}
```

It could make this even handier for practical use!
